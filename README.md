File Integrity Checker
📌 Overview
The File Integrity Checker is a simple Python tool used to verify whether files have been altered, corrupted, or tampered with.
It works by generating hash values (unique digital fingerprints) for files and comparing them with previously stored hash values.

✅ Features
Generates hash values (SHA-256 by default) for files.

Detects any modification, deletion, or corruption of files.

Can be used for security monitoring and data integrity checks.

Lightweight and beginner-friendly.

⚙️ How It Works
Hash Generation

When you first run the script, it generates a hash for each file and saves it in a hashes.txt (or JSON) file.

Example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
file1.txt : 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
Verification

On subsequent runs, the script recalculates hashes for files and compares them with stored hashes.

If the hash value matches, the file is unchanged.

If the hash value differs, the file has been modified or tampered with.

Output

The program prints or logs which files are unchanged ✅, modified ⚠️, or missing ❌.

🔒 What is a Hash?
A hash is a unique fixed-length string generated from file data using algorithms like SHA-256 or MD5.

If even a single character in the file changes, the hash will change completely.

Example:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Original: Hello World → b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9
Modified: Hello World! → 7f83b1657ff1fc53b92dc18148a1d65dfc2d4b1fa3d677284addd200126d9069# File-integrity-checker
